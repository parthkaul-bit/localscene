Introduction

Problem Statement:

India is a land of varied culture. Each and every state of India represents a different culture and has its own identity. Due to this, the festivals also differ from one state to other states. Thus, every state has its own festival. And the way of celebrating these festivals is also unique. However, most of the people don’t even know about their own local culture and festivals fully. According to a survey, 60% of the people admitted that they don’t know much about Indian culture, destinations, nature, food etc.This poses the problem of unawareness about one’s own culture, making our citizens lose the sense of pride that living in a country like India should impart in them.

Even when people are aware of their culture, they often don’t have an idea about where to find these events and participate in them. The system around cultural events is scattered and non-unified making it hard to keep up with what’s happening around their place.


Proposed Solution:

LocalScene is a website that helps citizens to get aware about the different cultural and festive events around India. This will help in staying connected with Indian heritage. Government and the locals are also benefited from the increasing local tourism but the current systems make it hard to publicise and sell these events to a wide audience. Government will be in a better place to plan these events too, after they know the expected footfall and interest of the public.

The website aims to have these features:


Information about the festivities of Indian states in blog format.
Registering for different kinds of local events on a prior basis.
Displaying the expected footfall of a particular event.
Setting alerts for all state-specific events.
